# PokemonAPI_Python
Retrieve multiple Pokemon and save their names and moves to a file
""" Question 3
In this session you used the Pokemon API to retrieve a single Pokemon. I want a program that can
retrieve multiple Pokemon and save their names and moves to a file.
Use a list to store about 6 Pokemon IDs. Then in a for loop call the API to retrieve the data for each
Pokemon. Save their names and moves into a file called 'pokemon.txt'

Steps: set up a list with 6 pokemon IDs
create a for loop, call the API to retrieve the data in each pokemon
open and write a file called "pokemon.txt"
Save the Pokemon names and moves in that file
